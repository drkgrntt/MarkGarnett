          Ignoring the alarm that morning wasn’t an option. It was the day I’d been waiting for since September. Tempting though it was to simply roll over and fall back into unconsciousness, I knew there wasn’t time. If I didn’t get up now, Mom and Dad would wake me up in twenty or thirty minutes, and I’d have to skip a shower. This day was going to be long, and a shower wasn’t a sacrifice I was willing to make. Still, after only two hours of sleep, interrupted periodically by violent coughing, nothing felt as precious as those few extra seconds in bed with my eyelids closed.
        </p><p>
          Get up, I told myself, forcing my eyes open and blinking them into focus. The rhythmic vibration of my cell phone sounded like a parade of elephants against the wooden nightstand. I heaved one arm over my body and yanked the phone from its charger. In a blaze of blinding light, the screen confirmed the alarm’s announcement:
        </p><p>
          January 2, 2:30 a.m.
        </p><p>
          I had a flight to catch.
        </p><p>
          The room went dark as I disabled the alarm, but seconds later, the thin crack in the doorframe was highlighted by the warm light of the hallway. Dad’s shadow quickly passed by the door, followed by Mom’s. Soon, the fresh scent of coffee seeped through the crack, accompanied by soft murmuring from the kitchen.
        </p><p>
          This is really happening. 
        </p><p>
          Get up. 
        </p><p>
          Now.
        </p><p>
          Throwing the blanket from the bed, I bolted upright and let out an excruciating cough. I was fed up with being sick. I’d spent the last week in a battle of wills against a cold that refused to let up. It was nothing serious—a cough mostly, but one hell-bent on making the last few days miserable.
        </p><p>
          Dragging myself to the bathroom took every ounce of willpower I had, but the shower that followed did wonders: I emerged fully awake and ready to take on the day. I covered my lower half with a towel and darted across the hall, pulling the bedroom door closed behind me.
        </p><p>
          Beside the bed sat the wadded pair of blue jeans I’d worn less than three hours ago. Operating on such little sleep was commonplace; mere weeks had passed since finals week at college. And anyway, the airport wouldn’t care how tired I was. My plane would take off at 6:00 a.m. whether I was ready or not.
        </p><p>
          Stretching a t-shirt over my wet, fuzzy hair, I flipped the light switch and left the bedroom. Taylor stood at the end of the hall, rubbing her eyes. She must have just woken up. Her hands fell to her side and our eyes met. Even on three hours of sleep, she was stunning. Walking the length of the hall, I took her into my arms and held tightly.
        </p><p>
          I was in love.
        </p><p>
          “Good morning, beautiful,” I whispered through her curly, red hair with my terrible morning breath. She mumbled a few words into my chest, muffled beyond recognition. We walked to the living room, hand in hand, and stood over the two purple bags on the floor, stuffed and zipped. Over the last week, Taylor had lent me her packing expertise. I decided what would stay and go, then passed it to Taylor, who folded it and packed it away. Together, we’d driven three hours north to my parents’ house in Kansas City, where we stayed overnight to say our goodbyes at the airport the following morning.
        </p><p>
          Taylor and I had a lot in common. We had the same sense of humor, the same love of people, and more than anything else, the same passion to see the world; it was what brought us together in the first place. Adventure was the heartbeat of our relationship. More often than not, though, the “adventures” of two college students working in a mall food court consisted of walking through parks, trying new restaurants, and watching old movies. Still, if we did it together, it was enough.
        </p><p>
          I hadn’t realized how cold it was that January morning until I opened the garage, allowing a gust of frigid air inside, stinging my exposed toes. Flip-flops probably weren’t the ideal choice for travel, but since my tennis shoes were packed away, they would have to do. Walking down the snow-laden driveway, Taylor and I threw the bags into the minivan parked on the curbside. She wasted no time running back to the house as soon as the case left her hands. I took my time at first, but the bite of the wind soon had me running too.
        </p><p>
          Mom and Dad left the radio off as we drove to the airport. The silence brought with it a peace, echoed by the stillness of the sleeping city covered in a fresh blanket of snow. I spent most of the drive peering out the windows, reminding myself that I wouldn’t see these familiar sights for months. In the distance, a digital bank sign flashed the time and temperature in warm, red numbers:
        </p><p>
          3:52 a.m., -2ºF
        </p><p>
          My hand clasped Taylor’s tightly as a flood of feelings and thoughts fought for my attention. How could I be so excited and so worried at the same time?
        </p><p>
          “You’re going to love it,” Taylor had assured me just before Christmas.
        </p><p>
          “Probably,” I agreed. “Still, six months without my friends, my church, without you—it won’t be easy.”
        </p><p>
          Taylor looked at me with her soft, blue eyes, gently illuminated by the glow of the Christmas tree. “I’ve got something to help with that,” she said, passing me a small box, wrapped in bright red paper. “I made this for you—for whenever you’re lonely or you need a pick-me-up.”
        </p><p>
          Inside the box was a black USB drive. “What’s this?” I asked, holding it between my finger and thumb.
        </p><p>
          “This is so you don’t forget about me and decide to stay in Honduras,” she said with a grin. “I filled it with a bunch of pictures and notes, and I recorded a few videos. You know—just encouragement.”
        </p><p>
          I was speechless. It was the best Christmas gift I could have received. “I love you,” I told her, caressing her cheek with my thumb.
        </p><p>
          “I love you,” she smiled back, offering a kiss to confirm it. “Merry Christmas, Mark.”
        </p><p>
          That night played in my mind like a scene from a movie as I stared out the window of the minivan. Leaving Taylor would be harder than I had prepared for. In that moment, I considered calling the whole thing off, demanding that Dad turn the van around and go back home. It would have been all too easy to give in to the fear of uncertainty that so plagued my mind.
        </p><p>
          It wasn’t like I was apprehensive about all of it. This had been my choice and I was riding a wave of excitement. I was the one who had made all the preparations over the last four months. It had been my idea in the first place. Still, I could no longer ignore the building fear—the fear of failure, of loneliness, of finding out things about myself that I hoped weren’t true. What if I wasn’t cut out for this?
        </p><p>
          What am I getting myself into? I thought as the final exit sign for Kansas City International Airport zipped by. This was certainly the beginning of a dream come true. I only hoped that it wouldn’t turn out to be a nightmare.
        </p><p>
          I’d spent hours praying about it, probably more than anything else I’ve prayed about in my life. As a kid, I was taught that prayer was the most important factor in making big decisions.
        </p><p>
          This might have been the biggest decision I had ever made.
        </p><p>
          I’d been a Christian for as long as I could remember. Mom and Dad got heavily involved in a Southern Baptist church when I was five, and they are still there to this day. If the doors were unlocked, we were there. By age eight, I could recite all sixty-six books of the Bible in order. By eleven, I could quote just about any verse in the Awana handbook. And by sixteen, I could explain how the Great Flood in Genesis killed all the dinosaurs, which of course, coexisted right alongside humans. I knew it all, and it felt good.
        </p><p>
          I spent the first twenty years of my life with my parents in Kansas City. Around the time I graduated high school, I got the itch to move out, to live on my own, to be an adult. Through a series of risks and mishaps, I eventually landed in Joplin—a town in southwest Missouri that no one had ever heard of before 2011, when a giant tornado ripped it in half. The move was everything I hoped for and far more. I joined a church, made a million friends, and even decided to finish college.
        </p><p>
          In the Spring of 2012, I enrolled at Ozark Christian College. A lot of OCC students will tell you that, after months of prayer and wise counsel, they felt God’s calling to Ozark; I chose the school because I didn’t want to take math classes.
        </p><p>
          A couple semesters in, a particular major caught my eye: TESOL, or Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (more commonly known as ESL or ELL). Being a fanatic for traveling the world and meeting people from different cultures, I declared TESOL as my major and dreamed of the day when I would put my education to use somewhere in the big blue world.
        </p><p>
          That opportunity came in an endlessly forwarded email during my final semester at OCC. Attached was a flyer, offering a paid teaching position at a small private school in Honduras. At the time, I didn’t even know where Honduras was (somewhere in Africa, right?), but I leaped at the opportunity. Two emails and a few legal documents later, I was formally offered a six-month paid teaching position at Santa Lucia Bilingual School in Oranado, Honduras.
        </p><p>
          I was ecstatic at the chance to fulfill my lifelong dream—the thing I had been working toward for the last three years—and at the age of 25, no less. Never mind that Honduras was a third world country or that I didn’t know a word of Spanish. This was an opportunity that I might never have again. The question was not whether I would accept the offer, but how soon I could begin.
        </p><p>
          Taylor supported me, my parents supported me, my friends and church supported me, and I was certain that God supported me. All the pieces had fallen into place. One final semester of college was all that stood between me and Honduras.
        </p><p>
          That final semester, though, was different than the others. Until that point, I had taken the majority of my classes at OCC. I decided, for the sake of time and money, to take a certain class through the local State University, Missouri Southern. That class was Anthropology 101.
        </p><p>
          Anthropology is the study of humankind, including society, language, ecology, and evolution. That last one is somewhat of a buzzword in those parts of the United States. A lot of Bible Belt preachers stay away from “the E-word,” except in sermons about Genesis 1, where the Bible clearly states that the earth and everything in it was created whole and complete. Until that point in my life, I hadn’t faced the hard facts of science, and was quite content to ignore the evidence against a literal six-day creation story. I was hesitant to publicly argue the point, but I was comfortable disregarding godless evolution myths in my own mind. 
        </p><p>
          Anthropology 101 made that blissful ignorance impossible.
        </p><p>
          I don’t know what Anthropology would have been like at Ozark Christian College, but it must have been radically different from the class I took at MSSU. The hardest part of going to class and learning contradictory information to what I believed about the Bible was that most of it made sense. One by one, the foundational building blocks of my faith-based Jenga tower were plucked out, until the tower became dangerously unstable.
        </p><p>
          It was at this point that I began to realize how many aspects of my life were tied to each other; you can’t pull the strings of one area without tugging at the whole. Praying was always hard for me, but when I began questioning the foundations of my faith, I stopped trying to pray altogether. I read the Bible scarcely, but even then, I didn’t hold it in any sort of esteem. I believed in a god, but I wasn’t sure which one or what it was exactly that I believed about him, or her, or them. By the time I graduated in December, my faith had all but disappeared. God was little more than an afterthought.
        </p><p>
          Even amidst the doubts and questions, I decided to go ahead with my plans. Honduras was waiting for me, and I wasn’t about to let anything get in the way of my next great adventure. Still, there was no denying that for the first time in my life, I didn’t know what I believed.
